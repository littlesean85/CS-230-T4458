Operating Platforms
# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
   The Gaming Room was a client we assisted in dveloping their game onto multiple platforms and getting it into group play modes.  So they have a game called Draw It Or Lose It, and the idea was team would be presented with an image and one person would have to draw it and have their teammates guess what it was. They had the game up and running on desktop platforms but they wated to widen their customer base and move it to fdifferent platforms including mobile. They wanted us to design it to be multi platform ready, and to help them get it ready for group play. 
   
# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
 IN this document I think I did well in describing what kind of design constraints and business constarints we might run into when working on this project.  Also completeing the UML diagram for the concepts of the deisgn for the program.  As well as providing recommendations to the clietn as to what operating system I would suggest to start with and then move to other operating systems, and strorage.
 
# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  When it came to the design document the portion that I found most useful when developing the code was the UML Diagram.  This is because it laid the road map for how the code would need to be developed when it came to classes and sub classes.
  
 # If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    If I had to chose one I would look at re-evaluating the evaulations portion of the dcoument.  This is because I'm not that familair with Linux so I feel I was limited on my resources and knowledge for filling that section out.  I would go about learning a litte bit more about Linux and see what can be added to look at the Pros and Cons of the usage of Linux when programming in regard to this project itself. 
    
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I looked into what the client was wanting to accomplish and then looked at what they ha dso far.  I wanted to know what their end goal was because I want to make sure that when I go through and develope the software.  It is important to consider their needs when desiging because they are your client, they have essentially hired you to help them with their need. If you aren't taking it into consideration you aren't ging to give them a product that they are happy with, nd in the end that is the number one goal.  We want to be able to present them with a product that works and is built to their wants and needs. 
  
# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I went about desiging the software by using the design document and UML diagram, so I had a ath to follow, so I didn't have to reinvent the wheel.  In the future I will continue to use UML Diagrams when programming similar software because ti does make it much easier.  I mean yes you can go to the software and just start programming but I have found that it is easier if you have aplan to follow first so you aren't going in blind, it will also help me limit any mistakes that coould potentially happen.
